Queue allow you to handle data in order, and then get rid of it once you donâ€™t need it anymore.
Quese are ideal for processing any data that should be handled in  order to how it was received.

In a queue, the first one to get in is the first one to go.

* data can only be insereted to the end of the queue
* data can only be read from the front of the line
* data can be only removed from the front of the line


The queue can be implemented using an array or linked list(get back to it after link list)****.



Analysis of Queue Operations(Array based Queue): 

1. Insert: O(1)
2. Delete: O(1)
3. Search: O(n)
4. Read: O(n)

Since you are only allowed to insert or remove data from the top of the stack, the delete and insert operation takes 1 step.

Practical Example:
In the queue.py I presented a simple queue class. I used the class to program the BFS algorithem in the graph hands in: '../graph/bfs.py'.
